Place.ge contains a large subset of the real estate market in Georgia. In the context of our partnership with [ISET (the International School of Economics in Tbilisi)](http://www.iset.ge/), JumpStart Georgia agreed to retrieve and organize the real estate data on place.ge for subsequent economic analysis. I wrote [the code](https://github.com/JumpStartGeorgia/Place-ge-Scraper) to scrape the data and save it to a database.
