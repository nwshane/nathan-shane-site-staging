[ScottShane.Net]({{page.main-url}}) is the site of Scott Shane, a journalist for the New York Times and author of the book Objective Troy. I built a custom Rails application for Mr. Shane, including:

- a [home page](http://scottshane.net/objectivetroy) featuring Objective Troy
- a fully responsive approach to the design
- a content management system for adding new [media](http://scottshane.net/media), [events](http://scottshane.net/events), and [reviews](http://scottshane.net/events)
- a [contact form](http://scottshane.net/contact) that forwards messages to Mr. Shane's email
