The web apps we build at JumpStart typically share a number of features: a custom content management system with authentication, multilingual support, Twitter Bootstrap for base styles, and more. We created this Rails 4 template so that we can hit the ground running at the start of every such project and spend more time on the custom components of each app.

Want to try it out, or think we should add a feature? [Check it out on github.]({{page.github-url}})
