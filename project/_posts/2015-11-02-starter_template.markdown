The web apps we build at JumpStart generally share a number of features and integrations: a custom content management system with authentication, multilingual support, Twitter Bootstrap for base styles, and more. We created this Rails 4 template so that we can hit the ground running at the start of every such projectâ€”this way we can spend less time on standard features and more on the custom components of each app.

Want to try it out, or think we should add a feature? [Head over to the github repo.][github-url]
