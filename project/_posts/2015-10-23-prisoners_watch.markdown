[Prisoners.Watch][site-url] provides authoritative, comprehensive and up to date information about political prisoners in Azerbaijan. I and my colleagues at [JumpStart Georgia][jumpstart-url] built this site in the hope that it would publicize and shed light on the deteriorating human rights of Azerbaijanis.

If you wish to contribute, [fork the repo on github][github-url] or [get in touch with us at JumpStart][jumpstart-contact-url].
